**Description:** Let's assume that we have two entities engaged in a one-to-many (or many-to-many) lazy bidirectional (or unidirectional) relationship (e.g., `Author` has more `Book`). And, we want to trigger a single `SELECT` that fetches all `Author` and the corresponding `Book`. This is a job for `JOIN FETCH` which is converted behind the scene into a `INNER JOIN`. Being an `INNER JOIN`, the SQL will return only `Author` that have `Book`. If we want to return all `Author`, including those that doesn't have `Book`, then we can rely on `LEFT JOIN FETCH`. Similar, we can fetch all `Book`, including those with no registered `Author`. This can be done via `LEFT JOIN FETCH` or `LEFT JOIN`.

**Key points:**
- define two related entities (e.g., `Author` and `Book` in a one-to-many lazy bidirectional relationship)
- write a JPQL `LEFT JOIN FETCH` to fetch all authors and books (fetch authors even if they don't have registered books)
- write a JPQL `LEFT JOIN FETCH` to fetch all books and authors (fetch books even if they don't have registered authors)
